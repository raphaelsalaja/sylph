# Installation

Follow these simple steps to get started:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server. Once the server is running, you can view your portfolio at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run the application:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: The URL of your website.

Run the following command to create a `.env.local` file and add the required environment variables:

```bash
vercel env pull
```

Then, update the values in the `.env.local` file with your own values.

# Scripts

The following scripts are available to help you manage development, build processes, and linting:

`build`

Runs the linting process, updates MDX file timestamps, and then builds the Next.js application for production. This ensures code quality and proper SEO metadata before deployment.

```bash
pnpm build
```

`postbuild`

Automatically generates the sitemap after the build process completes. This script uses the `next-sitemap` package to create a `sitemap.xml` file for better SEO and discoverability.

```bash
pnpm postbuild
```

`mdx:timestamps`

Runs a custom Node.js script that updates timestamps (`created` and `updated`) in your MDX files, automating the time management for blog posts.

```bash
pnpm mdx:timestamps
```

`lint:style`

Runs `stylelint` on all CSS files to check and automatically fix any style issues. This ensures consistent and clean CSS code.

```bash
pnpm lint:style
```

`lint:biome`

Runs the Biome linter to check and fix JavaScript/TypeScript code. This keeps your codebase clean and error-free.

```bash
pnpm lint:biome
```

`lint:prettier`

Runs Prettier to format your code according to your project's style guide. This improves code readability and consistency.

```bash
pnpm lint:prettier
```

`lint`

A combination of the style, Prettier, and Biome linting scripts, run together to ensure the entire codebase follows consistent style and format rules.

```bash
pnpm lint
```
